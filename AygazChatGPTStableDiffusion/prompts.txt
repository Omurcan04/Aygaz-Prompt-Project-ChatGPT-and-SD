FOR CHATGPT

Please act like mentor.Now on we will create a portfolio website about Gods of Scandinavian Mythology.
For this website we will use "HTML"," CDN for CSS" Bootstrap and JavaScript.
Also this website must be sensitive for mobile.
You are meant to give  HTML,CSS and JavaScript codes seperately.
This website must include latest style and latest versions of whatever we use.
Also further on we will use other AI platforms for images/gif's etc. Are you ready? Please answer yes or no.

This website must have header, main, nav, section, article, aside, footer .
I want this website looks really mythical coloring with blue dominated but red in it like mash-up this will be our background.
For every Gods of  Scandinavian Mythology we need grills with photo of that god. And when i hover that photo returns to a gif.
I need 6 grills for each site seperated to 2 lines.

Now let's go to the beginning. And re-write our code. All the rules stay same. I need a logo top-left of my website.
Under that i need a line with names of gods i have 6. And in the screen i need 6 squares with images in it. It must be hovered.
And under the squares there is a text inclued god's names. My images should perfect fit to the squares.

Now we should change the apperance. We have 6 squares. Make it bigger and right side of the squares there must be a text of abstract about god.
This abstract has a title to link a spesific site of that god. I mean if we are looking to the Odin abstract that titles move us to the odin's page.

Now rewrite our code again. Dont forget if you make a mistake or misunderstand me this is  gonna be your fault and you'll rewrite again.
Now i want my website look like this. Give margin left and right equally. Top left there is gonna be my logo.
Underthat there is gonna be "Scandinavian Mythology" centered text nearly half of the screen.
And as we scroll down we are going to see god's picture at the left side and right side there is gonna be text about that god.
All the pictures must be same size. Dont forget to use latest bootstrap and animations.
